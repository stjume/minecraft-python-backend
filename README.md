# Minecraft Python Backend

A simple minecraft plugin for sending commands to a server.

`The plugin was developed with spigot version 1.21.5` [download](https://getbukkit.org/download/spigot).

## Building

This project can be build using maven, just run the mvn command in the directory and it will build the `target/sk-mincraft-1.0.jar`:

```bash
mvn
```

### Creating the Server
Follow the [instructions](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-installation/#windows).
Basically.:
- Create an arbitrary folder
  - Create a new file (`.txt` is the simplest)
  - Put these three lines below in it (make sure to replace the version in the .jar's filename if needed.
  - Rename the file to `start.bat` (accept window's warning, we want the file to be executable).
  - Put the downloaded server-jar in the folder, next to the bat
  - Create a new folder inside your current folder, name it `plugins`
  - Put the plugin-jar, you built or downloaded in it
  
 ```@echo off
java -Xms#G -Xmx#G -XX:+UseG1GC -jar spigot-1.21.5.jar nogui
pause
```

## Usage

- This is a plugin intended to be used with a spigot server, just put the jar into the plugin folder.
- Then you can connect to the plugin via tcp on port `25595`.
- Send each command as a message over tcp, the message has to end with a newline.
- Each command is a commandname followed by a number of arguments. For explanation of the argument types see: [Arguments](#argument-types)

## Protocol Glossary

### General Notes

- The symbols around arguments: `<>` `??` `!!` indicate the type of the argument. [Type](#argument-types)
- A detailed explanation of each command can be found further down [Details](#protocol-details).
- Throughout the commands there are references to indices of online players, it is important to note that currently the index is completly based on the order the players joined in and will change if the players disconnect and rejoin. Currently there is no way to identify the players unqiuely based on a id.
  - You can of course still differantiate the players based on their names
- We use the symbol `𝇉` as the seperator between arguments

#### Dimensions

- Currently the following dimensions are available
  - `world`: the normal overworld
  - `world_nether`: The Nether
  - `world_the_end`: The End

## Argument Types

### Positional Arguments

Positional arguments are always the first arguments in argument list. They are marked as `<arg>`. They only consist of the value.

### Optional Arguments

Optional arguments are arguments that are strictly necessary but offer additional options.
They always have the form `<argument>:<value>` where `<argument>` is the name of the argument defined by the command and `<value>` is the value.
Optional arguments are marked as `?arg?`

Important usage guides for optional arguments are:

- There **must not** be a space anywhere in this configuration. If the value needs to contain a space please replace it with the sequence `|&s&|`, this will be interpreted as a space
- They must come **after** any positional arguments

### Flags

Flags are arguments that toggle an effect, the send command just needs to containe the name of the flag. They are marked by `!flag!`.

- They too must come **after** any positional arguments

### General notes

- Optional arguments and flags can be in an arbitrary order

## Protocol Details

- In each example the first line is the command you sent, the second line is a possible return. An empty return indicates that the server send nothing back.

- If you batch multiple commands which receive input the output comes line-by-line in the order of the commands in the batching command

#### Examples

- This example gives the player wooden pickaxe and post the message "Hello World this is a message" to the chat

```bash
batch ;|;addInv 0 wooden_pickaxe 1 unbreakable;|;postChat Hello World this is message`

```
